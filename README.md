# Structurizr for PHP

This repository is a port of [Structirizr for Java](https://github.com/structurizr/java).
All credits for creating [C4](https://c4model.com/) goes of course to [Simon Brown](https://github.com/simonbrowndotje)
this library is nothing more that simple port of the code that already exists in other language.  

# How to Use 

Don't use it yet, it's still under development and most useful features are still missing. 
Please look into [examples](./examples/) to find more about current progress.
